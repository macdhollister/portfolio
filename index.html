        <p id="bio">
            I'm Mac, an up-and-coming web developer! I graduated from the University of Washington in June, 2018 with a
            Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I began coding for engineering courses,
            mostly with MATLAB. After switching out of an engineering major into mathematics, I continued using MATLAB
            for data and numerical analysis. I additionally learned basics of Python and used it in a research paper
            about trends in leaked passwords, which can be found

            I discovered my passion for coding when I took an introductory Java course. After learning Java, I enrolled
            in a Web Application Security course. Learning about algorithms and data structures as well as web security
            fueled my interest to pursue backend development.<br>

                    Seattle Coffee Search was my first team-built web application. The idea of SCS is to provide an
                    easy way to find coffee in a certain neighborhood of Seattle. Once a user selects a
                    neighborhood, the nearest 50 coffee shops appear on the map. If the user wants to see more, the
                    map allows for clicking in any location and loading the nearest 50 coffee shops to wherever
                    they clicked.<br>
                    My responsibilities in this project included creating the Google Maps API call, researching
                    data for neighborhood boundaries, writing and implementing functions to place map markers, and
                    generally overseeing the clean merging of parts written by each group member.

                    This is my first professional project. This site features a rental home in Gig Harbor, WA. Created
                    using a Bootstrap framework.<br>
                    This site was also my first exposure to hosting a site on something other than GitHub pages. I used
                    Google Domains to get the domain name and the site is hosted through Netlify.
